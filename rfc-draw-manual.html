<h2 id="rfc-draw-manual-version-1.0">=== rfc-draw Manual, version 1.0 ===</h2>
<h3 id="getting-started">Getting started:</h3>
<p>Install rfc-draw in a new folder, e.g. ~/rfc-draw.<br />
In a terminal window, in your new folder, enter<br />
  python3 rfc-draw.py <em>save-file.rdd</em><br />
<em>save-file.rdd</em> specifies the file that rfc-draw should write as a record of your drawing; after that the same command will restore that drawing.</p>
<p>rfc-draw displays a single tkinter window; at the top is a white space to draw on, below that are a set of grey (on yellow) <strong>Mode</strong> buttons, and a white <strong>Message</strong> area. You can resize the window by dragging (using b1, your Left mouse button) any of it’s edges.</p>
<p>The <strong>Mode</strong> buttons tell rfc-draw what kind of objects you’re currently working on.<br />
The modes are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Rectangle<br />
 Lets you draw, resize and move rectangle objects.<br />
 An rfc-draw Rectangle has a Text (initially just “+”) at it’s centre.</p></li>
<li><p>Line<br />
 Lets you draw lines as a sequence of line segments,<br />
 with a direction arrow on each.</p></li>
<li><p>Text<br />
 Puts a text on screen, and allows you to edit and move it.<br />
 Multi-line texts are drawn with the lines centred.</p></li>
<li><p>Group<br />
 Creates and moves groups of objects.</p></li>
<li><p>Save<br />
 Lets you write an rdd file. That saves your drawing, but allows you to continue.<br />
 You can edit the filename as you would a text (see below)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Layers:</p>
<p>rfc-draw (and SVG) draw their objects in successive <em>layers.</em><br />
Layer 1 (the lowest) contains all your lines, and is drawn first.<br />
Layer 2 is then drawn over layer 1, it contains your rectangles.<br />
 That means that ends of your lines don’t need meet exactly at rectangle edges,<br />
 it’s easier to draw them with ends a little inside rectangles!<br />
Layer 3 (the highest) contains your texts.</p>
<p>When your drawing is complete, exit rfc-draw’s main window (by clicking on it’s ‘close’ button).<br />
rfc-draw will ask you “Save drawing as <em>save-file.rdd</em>?”<br />
Respond by clicking the main window’s Yes or No button.</p>
<p>In any mode:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Message area displays error messages (in red), warnings (in orange), and information messages (in black).<br />
You can clear the Message area by pressing the Pg Dn key.</p></li>
<li><p>You can <em>edit a text</em> by clicking it with b3, your Right mouse button;<br />
 that will display the text in a separate Edit Window.<br />
You can Backspace (erasing characters), or type in new text.<br />
‘Command’ keys perform the following actions:<br />
  Home  moves the edit cursor to the text’s start<br />
  End    moves the cursor to the text’s end<br />
  Return starts a new line<br />
  Esc    puts the edited text back, and closes the Edit Window</p></li>
<li><p><em>Deleting objects</em> from your drawing:<br />
 Don’t click on the object to select it, that would start drawing a new object!<br />
 The Delete key will delete the object under (closest to) the mouse pointer.<br />
 The Insert key will recover (a sequence of) recently-deleted objects.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Rectangles:</p>
<p>Press b1 down to start your line, then drag it down and to the right; that will draw a rectangle, with a text (just“+”) at it’s centre.</p>
<p>You can resize the rectangle by clicking near one of it’s corners (to expand or shrink the rectangle), or near one of it’s sides (to expand or shrink it in the direction you move that side).</p>
<p>You can edit the Rectangle’s text by clicking on it with b3, as explained in <em>edit a text</em> above.</p>
<p>Lines:</p>
<p>Lines are drawn horizontal or vertical. Press b1 down to start your line, then drag it right, left, up or down to make your line’s first <em>segment.</em><br />
After a first segment, add your next segment (in a different direction) by drawing from near your last segment’s end.</p>
<p>A line can be modified in various ways, as follows:<br />
 - Dragging from middle of a segment expands/shrinks line in the drag direction.<br />
 - Dragging from start or end of line extends that segment of the line.<br />
 - Dragging from any corner moves the whole line.</p>
<p> - Dragging a single-segment line from it’s middle moves it,<br />
   dragging it from just outside an end extends it.</p>
<p>Groups:</p>
<p>Press b1 to draw an Enclosing Dashed Rectangle (<em>edr</em>) around a set of objects.</p>
<p>Double-click b3 (your Right mouse button) and drag it to make a rectangle surrounding a set of objects. That Enclosing Dashed Rectangle (<em>edr</em>) defines your new group, together with the objects inside it.</p>
<p>You can now press b1 inside an edr, then drag it to move it’s group (with all it’s objects).</p>
<p>Properties of groups:</p>
<p>Groups allow you to move several objects at the same time.<br />
Objects within a group can be inividually edited or re-positioned;<br />
press b1 inside it’s <em>edr</em>, then drag it to it’s new position.</p>
<p>Changes to an object in one group don’t cause changes in any other group.</p>
<p><strong>Keyboard Actions:</strong></p>
<p>In any mode:</p>
<p>  key c to copy a tk object<br />
    u to unmake a group (leaving it’s objects where they were)</p>
<p>In Line mode:</p>
<p>  key a adds direction arrows to a line<br />
    n removes direction arrows from a line<br />
    f  flips (inverts) a line<br />
    r  reverses (LR to RL) a line<br />
    =  makes both ends of a line have the same height on-screen<br />
    e  sets Syntax End markers on a line<br />
    b  removes Syntax End markers from a line</p>
<p>When you have created a drawing, saved as an rdd file, you can convert it to SVG (python3 rdd-to-svg.py),</p>
<p> python3 rdd-to-svg.py <em>svg-file.rdd</em><br />
  Creates an SVG file, <em>svg-file.svg</em></p>
<p> python3 rdd-to-ascii.py <em>svg-file.rdd</em><br />
  Creates an ASCII-art file, <em>svg-file.txt</em></p>
<p>You can check that an svg drawing complies with RFC7996 using<br />
  jing -c SVG-1.2-RFC <em>my-drawing.svg</em></p>
<p>jing may give warning messages (about missing java apps), but<br />
not getting any error messages tells you that your SVG drawing complies.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can chceck your svg drawing using svg-check<br />
(from https://github.com/ietf-tools/svgcheck).</p>
